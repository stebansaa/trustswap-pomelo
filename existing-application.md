We are delivering a public good, all the code we deploy is open source under the MIT license and can be found at our Github repository: https://github.com/evm20



Your contribution will help us cover the cost of security audits, and design work on the project discovery features of our decentralized exchange. We have received quotes from two well established audit companies, for value ranging between $30,000 and $35,000.



Growth on our platform will come from the world realizing we offer a secure, easy, and enjoyable way of trading beyond the tech we build on top of. People just want to trade, make sure their funds are safe, and have a good UX, with low fees and sustainable incentives. This is why the unique EOS features like Yield+ and Recover+ are central part of our project, they allow us to provide a sustainable model for our token, and better security for our users.



Our code is a fork of Uniswap V2 with a fixed number of governance tokens being distributed to liquidity providers as an incentive.



The platform is currently on Testnet, and can be accessed at https://www.trustswap.finance, to test it you can obtain some EVM testnet tokens from a faucet here: https://faucet.testnet-dev.trust.one/ .
