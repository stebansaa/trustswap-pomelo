***

***


< DESCRIPTION CHANGE >

TrustSwap is a DEFI 3.0 exchange built for  Antelope EVMs. The high throughput of Antelope EVMs combined with an intuitive UI ensures a simplistic yet sublime user experience. This is a completely open-sourced and collaborative project with no outside funding, no token reservations and a non-inflationary tokenomics.

The EVM on EOS , TrustEVM Mainnet is soon to be released and the TelosEVM Mainnet 1.0 is active. An EVM on WAX is getting traction. The Antelope Coalition has proved the strength in unity. The future is multi-chain and TrustSwap positions itself to be an advocate of this multi-chain paradigm in Antelope Ecosystem and aims to provide value to it.

Growth on the platform will come from the world realising we offer a secure, easy, and enjoyable way of trading beyond the tech we build on top of. People just want to trade, make sure their funds are safe, and have a good UX, with low fees and sustainable incentives. 


## Why the name TrustSwap ?

The roots of this project is in TrustEVM and thus the name TrustSwap. In time the project evolved from only including TrustEVM and to be open to all the Antelope EVMs. This has put an uneasiness with the name TrustSwap and a potential rebranding is on the horizon. 

## What is the aim of raising funds through Pomelo ?

Your contribution will help us cover the cost of security audits, and design work on the project discovery features of our decentralised exchange. We have received quotes from two well established audit companies, for value ranging between $30,000 and $35,000.






## The State of TrustSwap

TrustSwap is now live on TelosEVM with a lot of improvements and upgrades and is ready to be launched on TrustEVM as soon as the mainnet is released. The unique EOS features like Yield+ and Recover+ will be a central part of the project which ensures safety of the user funds and a sustainable revenue model.

>Project Discovery : New crypto projects emerge daily, which makes it even more important to know how to find new crypto coins to invest in. The project discovery  feature helps in identifying the projects in Antelope Ecosystem and makes it easier to get involved in them with a simplistic design and multi-chain compatibility. It  is as easy as clicking a few buttons.
